            <h2>Theme of the Year</h2>
            <h3>Our theme for this upcoming year is to explore the Gospel and the major implications that follows from it. Our theme passage is Hebrews 10:19-25, and I think that it exemplifies many major aspects of the Gospel. During the year, we will 1) seek to understand the entirety of the Gospel as presented by the Scriptures, 2) hold fast onto  the promises and implications of the work of Christ in our lives, and 3) to actively live out our faith by being a witness of God and by walking alongside each other in faith.</h3>

            <h3 class="bible">Hebrews 10:19-25</h3>
            <h4>"Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh, and since we have a great priest over the house of God, 22 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful. And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near."</h4>
